# 🧮 NumPy Basics 

This repository contains a beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates core NumPy concepts with clear, practical examples. It serves as a hands-on reference for learning numerical computing in Python using the NumPy library.

## 📘 What's Inside

- Creating NumPy arrays using `np.array`, `np.arange`, `np.linspace`, etc.
- Array indexing, slicing, and reshaping
- Mathematical operations (addition, multiplication, broadcasting)
- Useful functions like `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.eye`, `np.sum`, `np.mean`, etc.
- Understanding array attributes: `ndim`, `shape`, `size`, `dtype`
- Random number generation using `np.random`

Each section includes both code and output to help reinforce learning.
